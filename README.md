# Cloud Architecture Optimization Project

This project aims to optimize cloud architecture solutions, helping organizations maximize the efficiency and scalability of their cloud infrastructures. The system uses FastAPI for the backend, FAISS for fast similarity search, Selenium for web scraping, and Ollama for AI-powered question answering.

## Overview

Organizations spend millions on cloud infrastructure but often struggle to identify the best architecture solutions for their use case. This project solves this problem by leveraging multiple technologies to provide the best possible cloud architecture based on various requirements such as performance, scalability, and cost efficiency.

### Key Technologies Used:
- **FastAPI**: The backend framework used to handle HTTP requests and serve the application.
- **FAISS**: A fast and efficient search engine for vector similarity search.
- **Selenium**: Used for web scraping to gather relevant cloud architecture examples and documentation.
- **Ollama**: AI-powered language model used for question answering and providing architecture recommendations.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project locally using Docker Compose.

### Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Docker**: To containerize the application.
- **Docker Compose**: To manage multi-container Docker applications.
- **Python 3.10+** (for local development or testing).

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
# azure-architecture
